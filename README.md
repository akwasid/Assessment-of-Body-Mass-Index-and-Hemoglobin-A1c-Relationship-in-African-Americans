This project investigates the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels among African Americans in central Virginia. Utilizing datasets from a comprehensive study, the analysis integrates baseline and clinical data from two cohorts. Advanced statistical techniques in SAS, including multivariable linear regression and LASSO-based selection, are employed to identify significant predictors and assess the impact of various factors such as age, sex, and lifestyle on the BMI-HbA1c relationship. The findings aim to inform targeted healthcare interventions for mitigating obesity and diabetes risks within this community.
